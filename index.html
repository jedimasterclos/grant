    <h2>Are Grants For You?</h2>
    <img class="pictures center-block" src="images/pic2.jpg">
    <div class="aboutText text-left col-xs-12">
      <p class="grant col-xs-9">If your agency has never applied for grants before, here are some questions to consider:
        <ul class="col-xs-9">
          <li>Are you a 501(c) 3 tax exempt organization or do you have such a fiscal agent?  Most funders will consider only tax exempt nonprofits, not individuals, and not any other 501(c) designation. They will also request a copy of the IRS letter.</li>
          <li>Have you been in operation at least three years?  Most funders expect this.</li>
          <li>Do your programs have verifiable outcomes and outputs for at least three years?  Simply put, outcomes are the changes, or impact, your organization is having on the issues you are addressing, and outputs are the metrics you collect that support these outcomes.  Most funders are looking for a positive track record.</li>
          <li>Do you have solid financial procedures using GAAP principles? Many funders will inquire about your processes and ask for current year budgets, previous year actuals, IRS Form 990, and audited financials.</li>
          <li>Do you have a Board of Directors? Funders will request their names and community affiliations.  They might also ask for copies of the organization's strategic plan, Articles of Incorporation, and by-laws.</li>
          <li>Other information to have handy includes newsletters or other publicity about your agency, your annual reports, and a listing of your key staff with a one paragraph resumes for each.</li>
          <li>If you can't respond, "yes" to all the above questions, that shouldn't stop you from considering grant funding but now is a very good time to start preparing.</li>
